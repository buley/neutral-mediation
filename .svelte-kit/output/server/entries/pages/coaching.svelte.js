	<h2>Our Value</h2>
	<p>There is so much untapped potential, and, as a result, so much conflict in the work to achieve it. Conflict coaching is a tested and effective approach to improving performance in our personal or executive lives. Conflict coaching empowers individuals to feel more confident and make hard decisions more rationally, even when faced with growth opportunities. With the help of a third-party service like Neutral Mediation, a client can learn and practice skills, techniques, and approaches to conflict that minimize anxiety and worrying, stop self-sabotaging behaviors, and put an end to procrastination. With the help and accountability of a trained coaching professional, dedicated to your progress, a conflict coach can help people better manage the human but negative emotions that bear corporeal witness to conflict via stress and unhappiness.
	</p>
	<p>Coaching is typically short-term and ongoing until a client is comfortable using conflict resolution techniques that empower them to move forward in their daily life.
	</p>
	<p>Fixed mindsets personas lead to beating yourself up or blaming other people for obstacles you may face. In contrast, a conflict coach invites you into a process of self-discovery: changing yourself, your relationship with the world, and, as a result, more effectively and positively influencing the circumstances around you. Coaches not only help to improve communication skills and success but encourage people to believe in themselves, who they are and who they can become. A coach invites you to dangerously discover who you are by receiving honest feedback tailored to improve and supplement your skills, attitudes, and behaviors. Clients joyously open themselves to new experiences and ideas and take conscious risks they may have otherwise avoided. 
	</p>
	<p>There are several tested models for life coaching available. They are often named after their acronym (or backronym). Most of them do the same thing: empower a third party to help someone set goals and then reach them, incrementally and iteratively, often achieving personal growth through identifying false or negative beliefs and behaviors. Example goal frameworks for coaching include the following:
	</p>
	<ul><li><strong>GROW</strong>: Goal, Reality, Options, Way Forward</li>
		<li><strong>SMART</strong>: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound</li>
		<li><strong>HEART</strong>: Honest, Exact, Authentic, Realistic, Timely</li>
		<li><strong>STEPPPA</strong>: Subject, Target, Emotions, Perception, Plan, Pace, Action</li>
		<li><strong>OSKAR</strong>: Outcome, Scaling, Know-How, Affirming Action, Review</li>
		<li><strong>CLEAR</strong>: Contract, Listen, Explore, Action, Review</li></ul>
	<p>To be successful in social life we need to be self-aware, understanding and honor our sense of integrity and self -- living in so-called &quot;congruence.&quot; Our thoughts, feelings, words, tone of voice, body language, facial expressions, and actions are all connected and engaged through emotion and storytelling. Congruence is the quality of these connections at the node and network levels. Authentic interactions occur when the cognitive and body-based systems are firing together and our actions work in accord with our perceived self-image.
	</p>
	<p>Thankfully, self-image can be coached and the resulting awareness engenders the congruence that brings us peace. Self-awareness is a trait that can be cultivated, exercised, and enhanced by any determined individual. Living authentically and self-aware can require greater situational stamina at the moment, but, long term, life is more balanced by living in congruence with principles and a positive self-image. Remarkably, increased awareness of ourselves allows us to truly see and hear others, too. Self-aware, courageous coaching sessions focus on opportunities and possibilities for learning, transformation, and transcendence.
	</p>
	<p>By increasing self-awareness through third-party conflict coaching, people can better use internal and external social feedback to improve their skills and performance, communication, and otherwise. Clients can also be more authentic, skillful, and content with who they are as human beings. Peacemakers can discover the vibrancy of the day-to-day world around them and become clearer, more authentic people. Nobody should be under the illusion that this is an easy process, but there is no alternative for peace of mind but to cultivate awareness, authenticity, congruence, and commitment.
	</p>
	<p>Once coaches and clients are clear about the origins of negative or destructive behaviors, a coach can help counterbalance our strengths and weaknesses. Clients live congruently with their values and discover more deeply who they are without denying or overcompensating for their past. They wake up, gaining a sense of identity, balance, and perspective \u2014 often by transforming external conditions and duress into an opportunity for growth \u2014 and encourage the same for those around them.
	</p>
	<p>A conflict coach helps a client understand new ways of communicating, overcoming defensiveness, and identifying targeted solutions to everyday conflicts. A coach helps clients learn from problems and play with solutions. A coach brings clarity, intention, power of observation, and personal commitment to improving the coaching relationship. Great coaches also use the process to transform themselves, too and learn new methods and insights, approaches, and growth opportunities.
