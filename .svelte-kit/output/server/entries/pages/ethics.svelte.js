	<div class="${"alignfull"}"><p>Mediators are not licensed, nor is there a professional organization to hold them accountable. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a mediator and the participant work <em>themselves </em>to hold the mediator accountable. A good mediator is transparent about their ethical approach and knows they&#39;ll build trust if you hold <em>them </em>accountable, too. Neutral Mediation believes in distinguishing ethical standards that underscore neutrality, honesty, self-determination, privacy, grit and style. Ethics compliment <a href="${"https://neutrals.io/recusal/"}">causes for recusal </a>to form the professional boundaries of mediation.</p></div>

	<h3>Neutrality</h3>

	<p><strong>Do not take sides.</strong> Is it fair to all concerned? Make them feel heard, give them an opportunity to hear. Never leave people hanging. A mediator should be curious, empathetic, understanding and non-judgmental. Cannot project own emotion or be otherwise self-centered. A neutral must be willing to use personal evaluation when, and only if, necessary, and only when requested by a participant. She cannot be both neutral and self-absorbed. A neutral should not take sides, unless when normatively acceptable to press a participant into continuing progress toward an agreement. The mediator\u2019s job is to go with the flow but stay aware of attempts at being spun. The perception neutrality must be cared for as well: private conversations should be avoided outside of caucus. </p>

	<h3>Honesty</h3>

	<p><strong>Do not lie.</strong> Is it the truth? The mediator must be a faithful agreement scribe, except in cases of fraud. She encourages honest and candor between participants, and demonstrates that herself. There will be absolutely no misrepresentation of fact, unless necessary to protect confidentiality. Honesty is expected from participants as well: even when full transparency is not afforded, the expectation is that parties will not knowingly misrepresent any material fact or circumstance. A neutral must be prepared to have hard conversations when necessary and not hold back when progress is possible. </p>

	<h3>Self-determination</h3>

	<p><strong>Do not bully. </strong>Mediators should only increase agency and never undermine self-determination. Parties make decisions, not the mediator, which ensures party participation and procedural fairness. A mediator should be relentless only in pursuit of an agreement, not in pressuring a side into a particular course of action. Mutual satisfaction must underpin all agreements. Although a mediator&#39;s suggestions may prove useful to participants, a mediator&#39;s job is to help parties identify the solutions that work for them and not prescribe them. <em>Due to expectations for self-determination, no minors are allowed in Neutral Mediation sessions.</em></p>

	<h3>Privacy</h3>

	<p><strong>Do not gossip.</strong> Mediations are confidential but not necessary private. At Neutral Mediation, conversations, even in caucus, are on-the-record by default but can be taken off-the-record or on deep background at any time. When given confidence, a mediator should protect her sources like journalist would shield hers. A mediator&#39;s private conversations do not leave the mediation session, ever. Trust in privacy is paramount and there are no exceptions to this policy except in narrow circumstances involving criminal activity. </p>

	<h3>Grit</h3>

	<p><strong>Do not quit. </strong>Neutrals are human: they get tired and have bad days. Clients with tough problems need a mediator who they can trust is going to hang on to the bitter end. A mediator needs to benergetic, enthusiastic and optimistic throughout. While quitting is always the participants perogative, the neutral needs to know that quitting is not an option for the mediator. </p>

	<h3>Style</h3>

	<p><strong>Do what you do. </strong>Almost everything is under the control of participants during a mediation session. One thing that is not? The mediator&#39;s style. Each mediator approaches the practice with a unique viewpoint and a neutral is most effective when honoring that style in a session. Neutral Mediation brings a fluid style that is compassionate and candid, empathetic and vulnerable, focused and forthright. Ethics play an important part of style, as well, and should be similarly unperturbed by the goings on of a mediation. So long as a mediator acts in a way that builds goodwill and stronger relationships then their style should be preserved and honored.<em>If you are concerned about mediation style, for example the lack of formality typical of Neutral Mediation sessions, preliminary consultancy appointments are a good opportunity to make sure the mediator&#39;s style matches the clients need in advance of the session.</em></p>

	<h3>Gifts</h3>

	<p><strong>Do not accept gifts.</strong> It is OK for a neutral to accept something that is available to the general public but gifts otherwise put a neutral in an awkward position and should be avoided. While it is unlikely that a gift would sway a good mediator&#39;s neutrality, managing the perception of neutrality alone is worth strict adherence to a no gift policy.</p>
