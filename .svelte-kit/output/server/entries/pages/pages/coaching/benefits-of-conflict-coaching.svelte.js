	<p>A conflict coach can help change thinking in order to improve subsequent emotions, decisions, actions and outcomes. Conflict coaches help to increase emotional wellbeing, reframe past experiences and change limited belief systems in order to move forward beyond stress and anxiety-producing conflict.
	</p>
	
	<p>Conflict coaches help clients set and achieve goals and make life changes by discovering and shaping self-identity. Coaches increase motivation and facilitate learning new skills. 
	</p>
	<p>A coach helps make sure a client&#39;s actions are consitent with their abmitiations, aspirations, core values and beliefs. Honesty, vulnerability and acceptance are some of the key skills that a conflict coach can develop.
