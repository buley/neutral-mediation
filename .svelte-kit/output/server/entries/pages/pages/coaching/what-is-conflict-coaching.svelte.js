<div class="${"content svelte-cf77e8"}"><h1>What Conflict Coaching Is</h1>

	<p>A conflict coach helps individuals move beyond the conflicts that prevent them from reaching their true potential in terms of peaceful happiness.  There are a number of coaching models but most revolve around personal growth through goals and accountability. A coach helps people develop specific, measurable, attainable, realstic and time-bound goals for themselves. 
	</p>
	
	<p>Like a building a muscle, a change in behavior is not immediate and takes work. Results are typically seen within three weeks.
