	<h2>Mediation Provisions</h2>
	
	<h3>Simple</h3>

	<p>In the event any controversy arising under this agreement is not resolved through negotiations between the parties, the parties agree to participate in a non binding mediation administered by Neutral Mediation (https://neutrals.io). This mediation must be conducted and completed before any party may commence a civil action or arbitration. Each side shall split the fees equally unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing. If the parties cannot agree on a Mediator within 45 days of requesting a hearing, Neutral Mediation will provide a Mediator based on substantive and procedural knowledge, availability and location. The mediation shall be completed within 90 days of the selection of the Mediator unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties in writing. The mediation will be conducted pursuant to, and governed by, <a href="${"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1115.&lawCode=EVID"}">California Evidence Code Sections 1115-1128</a>.</p>

	<h3>General Law</h3>

	<p>1. <em>Agreement to Mediate</em>: In the event of any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this\xA0 Agreement or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the\xA0determination of the scope or applicability of this Agreement (\u201CDispute\u201D), we agree to submit any such\xA0Dispute to mediation administered by Neutral Mediation  (https://neutrals.io).\xA0</p>

	<p>2. <em>Initiating Mediation</em>: Any party to this agreement may demand mediation at any time by serving a\xA0written demand in person or by mail to the opposing party with a copy of the demand and of this dispute\xA0resolution agreement to Neutral Mediation.\xA0</p>

	<p>3. <em>Enforcement</em>: The parties agree that the mediation provisions of this Agreement may be enforced in the\xA0same manner as an arbitration agreement, by petition to any court having jurisdiction for the appointment\xA0of a mediator in the same manner as a petition for the appointment of an arbitrator. Further, the parties\xA0agree the court may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the prevailing party in any proceeding to enforce this mediation agreement.\xA0</p>

	<p>4. <em>Fees and Costs</em>: The fees and costs of the mediator shall, in the absence of an agreement to be contrary,\xA0be borne equally by all parties.\xA0</p>

	<p>5. <em>Confidentiality of Proceedings</em>: The mediation process is to be considered a settlement negotiation for\xA0the purpose of all state and federal rules protecting disclosures made during such conferences from later\xA0discovery or use in evidence.\xA0</p>

	<p>The parties hereto agree that the provisions of <a href="${"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=703.5.&lawCode=EVID"}">California Evidence Code \xA7\xA7703.5</a> and <a href="${"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1115.&lawCode=EVID"}">1115</a>, et seq. shall apply to any mediation conducted hereunder.\xA0</p>

	<p>The entire mediation procedure is confidential, and no stenographic or other official record shall be made except to memorialize a settlement record. All statements, admissions, writings, promises and offers made\xA0during the mediation by any party or a party\u2019s agent, employee, or attorney are confidential and, where appropriate, are to be considered work product and privileged. Likewise, all conduct, views and opinions,\xA0oral or written, made for the purpose of, in the course of, or pursuant to the mediation or mediation\xA0consultant by any person (including any party, party\u2019s agent, employee, attorney mediator or other\xA0non-party) are confidential and privileged. Such conduct, statements, admissions, writings, promises,\xA0offers, views and opinions shall not be subject to discovery or be admissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any litigation or other proceeding involving the parties; provided, however, that evidence otherwise admissible or subject to discovery is not excluded from discovery or admission in evidence\xA0simply as a result of it having been used in connection with this settlement process.</p>

	<p>6. <em>Settlement</em> <em>Enforceability</em>: If enforcement of any settlement agreement reached during mediation\xA0becomes necessary, it may be enforced pursuant to <a href="${"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=664.6.&lawCode=CCP"}">Code of Civil Procedure section 664.6</a>.\xA0Notwithstanding the mediation confidentiality provisions set forth in <a href="${"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=EVID&division=9.&chapter=2.&article"}">Evidence Code sections 1115-1128</a>\xA0 and the confidentiality agreement of the parties, the settlement agreement may be introduced and admitted\xA0as evidence for this purpose. The prevailing party in any proceeding to enforce this settlement agreement\xA0shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.</p>

	<h3>Employee Law</h3>

	<p>Upon written notice of any dispute that arises out of or relates to an employee\u2019s employment with [Company] (the \u201CDispute\u201D), the parties shall attempt to resolve it promptly by negotiation between the parties who have authority to settle the Dispute. This process should be completed within 30 days (\u201CNegotiation\u201D).<br><br>If the Dispute cannot be settled through Negotiation, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the Dispute by mediation with Neutral Mediation (https://neutrals.io) lasting at least four hours, with payments split equally between participants, before resorting to arbitration, litigation or some other dispute resolution procedure. The process shall be confidential based on terms acceptable to the mediator.</p>

	<h3>Insurance Law</h3>

	<p>In the event of a dispute in connection with this Policy, the Insurer and the Insured (individually \u201Cparty\u201D and collectively \u201Cparties\u201D) shall, in the first instance, try to resolve such dispute through mediation. The mediation will be commenced by either party providing written notice to the other party requesting such mediation (\u201Cthe Mediation Request\u201D). The parties will use the services of Neutral Mediation (https://neutrals.io), within 30 days. If there can be no such agreement, each party will submit a list of five mediator choices to the other, rank ordered by preference. The mediator will then be selected based on a further discussion, unless an individual is on both lists and then that person would have preference. If the process does not result in the selection of the mediator, then the parties agree to let the named provider select the mediator. Subject to mutual agreement of the parties, the mediation will be held at a location within 100 miles of where the insured resides, not later than 60 days after the date of the Mediation Request and shall last for at least a one day session. Any settlement agreement reached at mediation and fully executed by all parties, however, will be binding on all parties.</p>

	<p>If the Mediation does not resolve the dispute within 60 days of the first mediation session or when the mediator declares an impasse, the parties agree that the Coverage Dispute shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Rules of JAMS before a single Arbitrator, unless the amount of coverage in dispute exceeds five million dollars, in which case the parties may choose to have the arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators chosen pursuant to the rules of <strong><em><strong>__</strong></em></strong>. The arbitration panel will all be neutral. The arbitration will be held within 100 miles of where the insured resides or at an agreed upon location in the United States. The arbitrator[s] may award the prevailing party costs and/or attorneys\u2019 fees for the Arbitration. Any State\u2019s law invalidating this paragraph shall not affect the validity of the first paragraph herein. The parties understand that arbitration is final and binding and that they are waiving their rights to other resolution processes (such as court action or administrative proceeding).</p>
