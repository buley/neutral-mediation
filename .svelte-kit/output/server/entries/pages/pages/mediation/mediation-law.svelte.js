	<h4 id="${"\xA71128"}">CA EVID \xA71128.</h4><p>Any reference to a mediation during any subsequent trial is an irregularity in the proceedings of the trial for the purposes of Section 657 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

	<h4 id="${"\xA71129"}">CA EVID \xA71129. Informed Consent Disclosure (SB 954, 2018)</h4><p>(a) Except in the case of a class or representative action, an attorney representing a client participating in a mediation or a mediation consultation shall, as soon as reasonably possible before the client agrees to participate in the mediation or mediation consultation, provide that client with a printed disclosure containing the confidentiality restrictions described in Section 1119 and obtain a printed acknowledgment signed by that client stating that he or she has read and understands the confidentiality restrictions.<br>(b) An attorney who is retained after an individual agrees to participate in the mediation or mediation consultation shall, as soon as reasonably possible after being retained, comply with the printed disclosure and acknowledgment requirements described in subdivision (a).<br>(c) The printed disclosure required by subdivision (a) shall:<br>(1) Be printed in the preferred language of the client in at least 12-point font.<br>(2) Be printed on a single page that is not attached to any other document provided to the client.<br>(3) Include the names of the attorney and the client and be signed and dated by the attorney and the client.<br>(d) If the requirements in subdivision (c) are met, the following disclosure shall be deemed to comply with the requirements of subdivision (a):<br>Mediation Disclosure Notification and Acknowledgment:<br>To promote communication in mediation, California law generally makes mediation a confidential process. California\u2019s mediation confidentiality laws are laid out in Sections 703.5 and 1115 to 1129, inclusive, of the Evidence Code. Those laws establish the confidentiality of mediation and limit the disclosure, admissibility, and a court\u2019s consideration of communications, writings, and conduct in connection with a mediation. In general, those laws mean the following:</p>
	<ul><li>All communications, negotiations, or settlement offers in the course of a mediation must remain confidential.</li>
		<li>Statements made and writings prepared in connection with a mediation are not admissible or subject to discovery or compelled disclosure in noncriminal proceedings.</li>
		<li>A mediator\u2019s report, opinion, recommendation, or finding about what occurred in a mediation may not be submitted to or considered by a court or another adjudicative body.</li>
		<li>A mediator cannot testify in any subsequent civil proceeding about any communication or conduct occurring at, or in connection with, a mediation.</li></ul>
	<p>This means that all communications between you and your attorney made in preparation for a mediation, or during a mediation, are confidential and cannot be disclosed or used (except in extremely limited circumstances), even if you later decide to sue your attorney for malpractice because of something that happens during the mediation.</p>

	<p>I, <strong><em><strong><em>_</em>.</strong></em>.</strong> [Name of Client], understand that, unless all participants agree otherwise, no oral or written communication made during a mediation, or in preparation for a mediation, including communications between me and my attorney, can be used as evidence in any subsequent noncriminal legal action including an action against my attorney for malpractice or an ethical violation.<br>I, <strong><em><strong><em>_</em>.</strong></em>.</strong> [Name of Client], understand that, unless all participants agree otherwise, no oral or written communication made during a mediation, or in preparation for a mediation, including communications between me and my attorney, can be used as evidence in any subsequent noncriminal legal action including an action against my attorney for malpractice or an ethical violation.<br>NOTE: This disclosure and signed acknowledgment does not limit your attorney\u2019s potential liability to you for professional malpractice, or prevent you from (1) reporting any professional misconduct by your attorney to the State Bar of California or (2) cooperating with any disciplinary investigation or criminal prosecution of your attorney.<br>[Name of Client] [Date signed] [Name of Attorney] [Date signed]<br>(e) Failure of an attorney to comply with this section is not a basis to set aside an agreement prepared in the course of, or pursuant to, a mediation.<br></p>

	<h3>California Evidence Code \xA7703.5: Testimony by a judge, arbitrator, or mediator</h3>

	<h4 id="${"\xA7703.5"}">CA EVID \xA7703.5.</h4><p>Judges, arbitrators or mediators as witnesses; subsequent civil proceeding.<br>No person presiding at any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding, and no arbitrator or mediator, shall be competent to testify, in any subsequent civil proceedings, as to any statement, conduct, decision, or ruling, occurring at or in conjunction with the prior proceeding, except as to a statement or conduct that could (a) give rise to civil or criminal contempt, (b) constitute a crime, (c) be the subject of investigation by the State Bar or Commission on Judicial Performance, or (d) give rise to disqualification proceedings under paragraph (1) or (6) of subdivision (a) of Section 170.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, this section does not apply to a mediator with regard to any mediation under Chapter 11 (commencing with Section 3160) of Part 2 of Division 8 of the Family Code.</p>

	<h3 id="${"ccp"}" name="${"ccp"}">California Code, Code of Civil Procedure</h3>

	<h4 id="${"\xA71775.10"}">Code Civ. Proc. \xA71775.10</h4><p>All statements made by the parties during the mediation shall be subject to Sections 703.5 and 1152 and 1152.5, and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 1115) of Division 9, of the Evidence Code.</p>
