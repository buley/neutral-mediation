	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>I have gradually come to one negative conclusion about the good life. It seems to me that the good life is not any fixed state. It is not, in my estimation, a state of virtue, or contentment, or nirvana, or happiness. It is not a condition in which the individual is adjusted or fulfilled or actualized. To use psychological terms, it is not a state of drive-reduction, or tension-reduction, or homeostasis.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Attach no importance to self-seeking, rejection, arrogance, oppression and enmity. Heed them not. Deal in the contrary way. Be kind in truth, not only in appearance and outwardly. Every soul of the friends of God must concentrate his mind on this, that he may manifest the mercy of God and the bounty of the Forgiving One. He must do good to every soul whom he encounters, and render benefit to him, becoming the cause of improving the morals and correcting the thoughts so that the light of guidance may shine forth and the bounty of His Holiness the Merciful One may encompass. Love is light in whatsoever house it may shine and enmity is darkness in whatsoever abode it dwell.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Everybody in the world is seeking happiness\u2014and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn&#39;t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions. It isn&#39;t what you have or who you are or what you are doing that makes you happy or unhappy. It is what you think about it.</p></blockquote>

the very complex.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Martin Rees
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>What is commonly called &#39;disorder&#39; is merely an inappropriate name for what is actually a certain rather complex kind of order that is difficult to describe in full detail. Our real task can, therefore, never be to judge whether something is ordered or disordered, because everything is ordered, because disorder in the sense of the absence of every conceivable kind of order is an impossibility. Rather, What one really has to do is to observe and describe the kind of order that each thing actually has.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>A man whose desire is to be something separate from himself, to be a member of Parliament, or a successful grocer, or a prominent solicitor, or a judge, or something equally tedious, invariably succeeds in being what he wants to be. That is his punishment. Those who want a mask have to wear it.</p></blockquote>

		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>If you cry, &#39;Forward!&#39; you must be sure to make clear the direction in which to go. Don&#39;t you see that if you fail to do that and simply call out the word to a monk and a revolutionary, they will go in precisely	opposite directions?</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Anton Chekhov
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>A culture that allows the concept of \u2018safety&#39; to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in everyday life that they need in order to become strong and healthy.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, <em><em>The Coddling of the American Mind</em></em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Haim G. Ginott, <em>Teacher and Child</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>A master in the art of living knows no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself he always seems to be doing both.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">George Bernard Shaw
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.</p></blockquote>
