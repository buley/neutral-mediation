This \u2018outgrowing&#39;, as I formerly called it, on further experience was seen to consist in a new level of consciousness. Some higher or wider interest arose on the person&#39;s horizon, and through this widening of view, the insoluble problem lost its urgency. It was not solved logically in its own terms, but faded out when confronted with a new and stronger life-tendency.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>I remember Rudi [a friend and teacher] saying once that all life is about transcendence. If you\u2019re ugly you have to transcend your ugliness, if you\u2019re beautiful you have to transcend your beauty, if you\u2019re poor you have to transcend your poverty, if you\u2019re rich you have to transcend your wealth\u2026 There is nothing worse than being born extraordinarily beautiful, nothing more potentially damaging to the self. You could say the same for being born inordinately rich. You suddenly realize how wise the idea is that you get nothing at birth except things to transcend. That\u2019s all you get.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on\u2014 it isn&#39;t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn&#39;t give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance\u2014 unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Tending the garden is a relaxing pastime, but it does not prepare one for the inevitable battles of life. It is easy to be calm in a serene setting.</p>
			<p>To be calm and serene when under attack is much more difficult; therefore, I tell you that it is far better to be a warrior tending his garden rather than a gardener at war.</p></blockquote>

			<p>I give them the hours I spend away from them and carry them, even in my sleep, at least as the nag of a misplaced shoe, for years after I have quit and gone on to another job where I hesitate in telling and I remember and I resent having had to spend more time with them than with the ones I love.</p></blockquote>
