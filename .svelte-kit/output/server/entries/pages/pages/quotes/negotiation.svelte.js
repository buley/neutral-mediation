	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Genuine politics \u2013 politics worthy of the name, and the only politics I am willing to devote myself to \u2013 is simply a matter of serving those around us: serving the community, and serving those who will come after us. It&#39;s deepest roots are moral because it is a responsibility \u2026 [T]here is only one way to strive for decency, reason, responsibility, sincerity, civility, and tolerance, and that is decently, reasonably, responsibly, sincerely, civilly, and tolerantly. I&#39;m aware that, in everyday politics, this is not seen as the most practical way of going about it.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>The society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting by fools.</p></blockquote>

		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you&#39;re wrong?<br>
			<br>
			\u2026Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you&#39;re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you&#39;re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.</p></blockquote>
