	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Conflict is the sound made by the cracks in a system, the manifestation of contradictory forces coexisting in a single space.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>So long as only one ideal is the true goal, it will always seem to men that no means can be too difficult, no price too high, to do whatever is required to realize the ultimate goal. Such certainty is one of the great justifications of fanaticism, compulsion, persecution \u2026. If there is only one solution to the puzzle, then the only problems are first how to find it, then how to realize it, and finally how to convert others to the solution by persuasion or by force. But if this is not so \u2026, then the path is open to empiricism, pluralism, tolerance, compromise. Tolerance is historically the product of the realization of the irreconcilability of equally dogmatic faiths, and the practical improbability of complete victory of one over the other. Those who wished to survive realized that they had to tolerate error. They gradually came to see the merits of diversity, and so became skeptical about definitive solutions in human affairs.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>LET US RECAPITULATE A BIT: The great enemy of communication, we find, is the illusion of it. We have talked enough; but we have not listened. And by not listening we have failed to concede the immense complexity of our society\u2013and thus the great gaps between ourselves and those with whom we seek understanding.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>When we listen to people, our language softens. Listening may be the cardinal act of giving... It is the source of peace.</p></blockquote>

		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Peter Senge
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>In order to listen, here are some suggestions: Try to learn tranquility, to live in the present a part of the time every day. Sometimes say to yourself: &quot;Now. What is happening now? This friend is talking. I am quiet. There is endless time. I hear it, every word.&quot; Then suddenly you begin to hear not only what people are saying, but also what they are trying to say, and you sense the whole truth about them. And you sense existence, not piecemeal, not this object and that, but as a translucent whole.</p>
			<p>Then watch your self-assertiveness. And give it up. Remember, it is not enough just to will to listen to people. One must really listen. Only then does the magic begin.</p>
			<p>We should all know this: that listening, not talking, is the gifted and great role, and the imaginative role. And the true listener is much more beloved, magnetic than the talker, and he is more effective and learns more and does more good. And so try listening. Listen to your wife, your husband, your father, your mother, your children, your friends; to those who love you and those who don&#39;t, to those who bore you, to your enemies. It will work a small miracle. And perhaps a great one.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>By embracing the inescapable, I lost my fear of it. I\u2019ll tell you a secret about fear: its an absolutist. With fear, its all or nothing. Either, like any bullying tyrant, it rules your life with a stupid blinding omnipotence, or else you overthrow it, and its power vanishes like a puff of smoke. And another secret: the revolution against fear, the engendering of that tawdry despots fall, has more or less nothing to do with \u2018courage\u2019. It is driven by something much more straightforward: the simple need to get on with your life.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>So it is with you. Unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue, how will anyone know what you are saying? You will just be speaking into the air.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">1 Corinthians, <em>14:9</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force \u2026 When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. Ideas actually begin to grow within us and come to life. \u2026 It makes people happy and free when they are listened to.</p></blockquote>

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Listening is not something that we do all the time. It&#39;s work. It&#39;s a commitment.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Krista Tippett
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>It&#39;s easy to listen if we like what the other person is saying. However, we don&#39;t listen well when we&#39;re under fire because we are hard wired for defensiveness... When we listen defensively, we automatically listen for what we don&#39;t agree with. We listen for the exaggerations, errors and distortions that will inevitably be there... Let&#39;s face it. Almost all of us are more invested in improving our talking skills than in improving our listening skills. Our desire to be understood is far stronger than our desire to understand the other person.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Dr. Harriet Lerner
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>I want to write about the great and powerful thing that listening is. And how we forget it. And how we don\u2019t listen to our children, or those we love. And least of all \u2013 which is so important, too \u2013 to those we do not love. But we should. Because listening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force. Think how the friends that really listen to us are the ones we move toward, and we want to sit in their radius as though it did us good, like ultraviolet rays.</p>
			<p>This is the reason: When we are listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand. Ideas actually begin to grow within us and come to life. You know how if a person laughs at your jokes you become funnier and funnier, and if he does not, every tiny little joke in you weakens up and dies. Well, that is the principle of it. It makes people happy and free when they are listened to. And if you are a listener, it is the secret of having a good time in society (because everybody around you becomes lively and interesting), of comforting people, of doing them good.

	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>And if two factions among the believers should fight, then make settlement between the two. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the ordinance of Allah . And if it returns, then make settlement between them in justice and act justly. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Qur&#39;an, 49:9
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>The absence of conflict is not harmony, it&#39;s apathy. If you&#39;re in a group where people never disagree, the only way that could really happen is if people don&#39;t care enough to speak their minds.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="${"pullquote"}">Adam Grant
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>Our \u2018opponents&#39; are our co-creators, for they have something to give which we have not. The basis of all cooperative activity is integrated diversity... What people often mean by getting rid of conflict is getting rid of diversity, and it is of the utmost importance that these should not be considered the same. We may wish to abolish conflict, but we cannot get rid of diversity. We must face life as it is and understand that diversity is its most essential feature... Fear of difference is dread of life itself. It is possible to conceive conflict as not necessarily a wasteful outbreak of incompatibilities, but a normal process by which socially valuable differences register themselves for the enrichment of all concerned.</p></blockquote>

		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="${"pullquote"}"><p>In any system, once a relative orderliness has been achieved, the only means by which a broader and more complex interrelationship among the various elements can be achieved is by introducing or generating disorder. The system can come apart to be put together in a much more integrated way. Any system that resists this creative disintegration and re-integration can only suffer the gradual erosion of its established order due to the energy required to protect the system from change.</p></blockquote>
