	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>We don’t have to do all of it alone. We were never meant to.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Brené Brown
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>How much better to heal than seek revenge from injury. Vengeance wastes a lot of time and exposes you to many more injuries than the first that sparked it. Anger always outlasts hurt. Best to take the opposite course.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Seneca
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>You train to become a warrior, not a fighter. The warrior knows the hell he can let loose, so he chooses the path of peace and respect.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Shi Yan You
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>There are three great frontiers in science: the very big, the very small and
the very complex.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Martin Rees
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>What is commonly called &#39;disorder&#39; is merely an inappropriate name for what is actually a certain rather complex kind of order that is difficult to describe in full detail. Our real task can, therefore, never be to judge whether something is ordered or disordered, because everything is ordered, because disorder in the sense of the absence of every conceivable kind of order is an impossibility. Rather, What one really has to do is to observe and describe the kind of order that each thing actually has.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">David Bohm
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The essence of tyranny is the denial of complexity.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Jacob Burkhardt
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>So long as only one ideal is the true goal, it will always seem to men that no means can be too difficult, no price too high, to do whatever is required to realize the ultimate goal. Such certainty is one of the great justifications of fanaticism, compulsion, persecution …. If there is only one solution to the puzzle, then the only problems are first how to find it, then how to realize it, and finally how to convert others to the solution by persuasion or by force. But if this is not so …, then the path is open to empiricism, pluralism, tolerance, compromise. Tolerance is historically the product of the realization of the irreconcilability of equally dogmatic faiths, and the practical improbability of complete victory of one over the other. Those who wished to survive realized that they had to tolerate error. They gradually came to see the merits of diversity, and so became skeptical about definitive solutions in human affairs.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Isaiah Berlin
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Genuine politics – politics worthy of the name, and the only politics I am willing to devote myself to – is simply a matter of serving those around us: serving the community, and serving those who will come after us. It&#39;s deepest roots are moral because it is a responsibility … [T]here is only one way to strive for decency, reason, responsibility, sincerity, civility, and	tolerance, and that is decently, reasonably, responsibly, sincerely, civilly, and tolerantly. I’m aware that, in everyday politics, this is not seen as the most practical way of going about it.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Vaclav Havel
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Listen to both sides and you will be enlightened; listen to only one side and you will be left in the dark</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Wei Zheng
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>When a society decays, it is language that is first to become gangrenous.... Although moralists are scandalized by the fortunes amassed by the revolutionaries [in Mexico under the ruling party], they have failed to	observe that this material flowering has a verbal parallel; oratory has become the favorite literary genre of the prosperous... and alongside oratory, with its plastic flowers, there is the barbarous syntax in many of our newspapers, the foolishness of language on loudspeakers and the radio, the loathsome vulgarities of advertising -- all that asphyxiating rhetoric.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Octavio Paz
		</figcaption></figure>	
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Choosing to be curious is choosing to be vulnerable because it requires us to surrender to uncertainty. It wasn&#39;t always a choice; we were born curious.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Brené Brown
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Desmond Tutu
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>If you cry, &#39;Forward!&#39; you must be sure to make clear the direction in which to go. Don&#39;t you see that if you fail to do that and simply call out the word to a monk and a revolutionary, they will go in precisely	opposite directions?</p></blockquote>

		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>People don&#39;t resist change. They resist being changed.</p></blockquote>

		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I&#39;m not concerned with your liking or disliking me… All I ask is that you respect me as a human being.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Jackie Robinson
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>A culture that allows the concept of ‘safety’ to creep so far that it equates emotional discomfort with physical danger is a culture that encourages people to systematically protect one another from the very experiences embedded in everyday life that they need in order to become strong and healthy.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, <em><em>The Coddling of the American Mind</em></em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Dignity does not consist in possessing honors, but in deserving them.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Aristotle
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>[T]he latest and most formidable form of … domination [is]
	bureaucracy … which could be properly called rule by Nobody. If, in
	accord with traditional political thought, we identify tyranny as
	government that is not held to give account of itself, rule by Nobody is
	clearly the most tyrannical of all, since there is no one left who would
	even be asked to answer for what is being done.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Hannah Arendt, <em><cite>On Violence</cite></em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The very essence of the creative is its novelty, and hence we have no standard by which to judge it.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Carl Rogers, <em>On becoming a person</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Treat people well, regardless of their differences.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Dr. George Thompson
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element. It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what they are capable of becoming.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Haim G. Ginott, <em>Teacher and Child</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>No person hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do each of us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we should all be the toughest misers.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Seneca, <em>On the Brevity of Life</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>It is quite true that man lives by bread alone — when there is no bread. But what happens to man’s desires when there is plenty of bread and when his belly is chronically filled?</p>
			<p>At once other (and &#39;higher&#39;) needs emerge and these, rather than physiological hungers, dominate the organism. And when these in turn are satisfied, again new (and still &#39;higher&#39;) needs emerge and so on. This is what we mean by saying that the basic human needs are organized into a hierarchy of relative prepotency.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Abraham H. Maslow, <em>A Theory of Human Motivation</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>A person cannot teach another person directly; a person can only facilitate another&#39;s learning.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Carl Rogers, <em>Client-centered therapy</em></figcaption></figure>
	<h2 id="emotion">Emotion Quotes</h2>

		<figcaption class="pullquote">Marcus Aurelius
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>When dealing with people, remember you are not dealing with creatures of logic, but with creatures of emotion.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Dale Carnegie
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Men decide far more problems by hate, love, lust, rage, sorrow, joy, hope, fear, illusion or some other inward emotion, than by reality, authority, any legal standard, judicial precedent, or statute.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Marcus Tullius Cicero
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>We are more often frightened than hurt; and we suffer more from imagination than from reality.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Seneca
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p> &quot;Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope empathy, accountability, and authenticity.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Brené Brown
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Vulnerability is scary, but it&#39;s better than getting to the end of your life and realizing that you didn&#39;t show up or be seen.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Brené Brown, <em>Dare Greatly</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Those who are skilled in combat do not become angered, those who are skilled at winning do not become afraid. Thus the wise win before the fight, while the ignorant fight to win.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Morihei Ueshiba
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Anyone can become angry…That is easy. But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not easy.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Aristotle, <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em></figcaption></figure>

	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote" id="go-to-your-bosom-knock-there-and-ask-your-heart-what-it-doth-know"><p>Go to your bosom; Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">William Shakespeare, <em>Measure for Measure</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The definition of vulnerability is uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure.</p>
			<p>But vulnerability is not weakness; it&#39;s our most accurate measure of courage.</p>
			<p>When the barrier is our belief about vulnerability, the question becomes: &#39;Are we willing to show up and be seen when we can&#39;t control the outcome?&#39;</p>
			<p>When the barrier to vulnerability is about safety, the question becomes: &#39;Are we willing to create courageous spaces so we can be fully seen?&#39;</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Brené Brown, <em>Braving the Wilderness</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only when you permit yourself to be disturbed by him.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Epictetus
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>The greatest remedy for anger is delay.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Seneca
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on— it isn’t manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn’t give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance— unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Marcus Aurelius
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>True knowledge of God is gained when the lover comes in contact with the Beloved through secret communion with Him.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Sufi proverb
		</figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Tending the garden is a relaxing pastime, but it does not prepare one for the inevitable battles of life. It is easy to be calm in a serene setting.</p>
			<p>To be calm and serene when under attack is much more difficult; therefore, I tell you that it is far better to be a warrior tending his garden rather than a gardener at war.</p></blockquote>

		<figcaption class="pullquote">Marcus Aurelius, <em>Meditations</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can also hurt me.</p>
			<p>Stones and sticks break only skin, while words are ghosts that haunt me.</p>
			<p>Slant and curved the word-swords fall, it pierces and sticks inside me.</p>
			<p>Bats and bricks may ache through bones, but words can mortify me.</p>
			<p>Pain from words has left its’ scar, on mind and hear that’s tender.</p>
			<p>Cuts and bruises have not healed, it’s words that I remember.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Ruby Redfort, <em>Sticks and Stones</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>I have gradually come to one negative conclusion about the good life. It seems to me that the good life is not any fixed state. It is not, in my estimation, a state of virtue, or contentment, or nirvana, or happiness. It is not a condition in which the individual is adjusted or fulfilled or actualized. To use psychological terms, it is not a state of drive-reduction, or tension-reduction, or homeostasis.</p></blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">Carl Rogers, <em>Person to person</em></figcaption></figure>
	<figure><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>Anger brings about nothing grand or beautiful. On the other hand, to be constantly irritated seems to me to be the part of a languid and unhappy mind, conscious of its own feebleness.</p></blockquote>
