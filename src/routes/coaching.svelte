	<h3>What Is Conflict Coaching?</h3>
	<p>
		A conflict coach helps individuals move beyond the conflicts that prevent them from reaching their true potential in terms of peaceful happiness.  There are a number of coaching models but most revolve around personal growth through goals and accountability. A coach helps people develop specific, measurable, attainable, realstic and time-bound goals for themselves. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Like a building a muscle, a change in behavior is not immediate and takes work. Results are typically seen within three weeks. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Weekly, fortnightly or monthly sessions are regular. Long-term coaching sometimes involves homework such as exercises or journaling.
	</p>
	<h3>Benefits of Conflict Coaching</h3>
	<p>
		A conflict coach helps people change their thinking in order to change subsequent emotions, decisions, actions and outcomes. They help to increase emotional wellbeing, reframe past experiences and change limited belief systems. They help people set and achieve goals, make life changes, increase motivation, learn new skills and discover and change their self-identity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Honesty and acceptance are key skills. A coach helps make sure a client's actions are consitent with their abmitiations, aspirations, core values and beliefs.
