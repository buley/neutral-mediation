	<h3>What Is Conflict Coaching?</h3>
	
	<p>
		A conflict coach helps individuals move beyond the conflicts that prevent them from reaching their true potential in terms of peaceful happiness.  There are a number of coaching models but most revolve around personal growth through goals and accountability. A coach helps people develop specific, measurable, attainable, realstic and time-bound goals for themselves. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Like a building a muscle, a change in behavior is not immediate and takes work. Results are typically seen within three weeks. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Weekly, fortnightly or monthly sessions are regular. Long-term coaching sometimes involves homework such as exercises or journaling.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A regular coaching session may follow the following structure:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="numbered-list">
		<li>Check-in for an update on changes and progress since last session, including reviewing any homework or follow-up exercises.</li>
		<li>Reassess goals and other desired outcomes.</li>
		<li>Determine the reality gap: the distance between where the client is today and where they want to be.</li>
		<li>Brainstorm options, explore solutions and incremental action steps that are available.</li>
		<li>Plan on and agree to certain action steps.</li>
		<li>Assign any homework and follow-up exercises.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Benefits of Conflict Coaching</h3>
	
	<p>
		A conflict coach can help change thinking in order to improve subsequent emotions, decisions, actions and outcomes. Conflict coaches help to increase emotional wellbeing, reframe past experiences and change limited belief systems in order to move forward beyond stress and anxiety-producing conflict.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		They help set and achieve goals, make life changes, increase motivation, facilitate learning new skills and discover and change self-identity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Honesty, vulnerability and acceptance are among the key skills that a conflict coach can help someone develop. A coach helps make sure a client's actions are consitent with their abmitiations, aspirations, core values and beliefs.
	</p>

	<h3>Pillars of Coaching</h3>

	<p>
		A coach helps to develop the 8c’s & 5p’s of self: curiosity, compassion, clarity, connectedness, creativity, courage, confidence and calm; patience, presence, persistence, perspective and playfulness.
	</p>

	<p>
		To accomplish this, conflict coaching can help to instill mindfulness, honesty, vulnerability and accountability.
	</p>
 
	<h4>Mindfulness</h4>

	<p>
		The a growth mindset reframes negative experiences and encourages failure as an opportunity to learn and grow in areas in which you are not yet competent. Confidence increases as fear subsides amid self-honesty and incremental assessment.
	</p>

	<p>
		By changing the approach to being pushed outside our comfort zones we can be more resiliant, better at coping with failture, and thereby become more likely to challenge ourselves, developing true passions.
	</p>

	<h4>Honesty</h4>

	<p>
		Socratic questioning and utilitarian techniques help us iteratively dig into the problems that we face and how they impact us. To assess our options to move forward toward our goals, we must be honest about the meaningful positive and negative impacts of our choices. 
	</p>

	<h4>
		Vulnerability
	</h4>

	<p>
		Vulnerability creates bonding and trust in the face of the uncertainty of emotional exposure. This is a necessary step to be able to truly communicate with eachother -- to speak fully, and listen fully. It allows us to discuss the conflicts that face us freely, confidently and authentically. It encourages acceptance, confidence, respect, forgiveness, consistency and accountability
	</p>

	<h4>Acceptance</h4>

	<p>
		To fully understand what options and choices that we face, we must accept reality without precluding judgment. Acceptance of yourself, and others, and life circumstances. Anything can be changed as long once we can reflect on what it is and what it means.
	</p>

	<h4>Accountability</h4>

	<p>
		Regular coaching involves personal accountability for achieving the steps necessary to take steps toward our goals. A coach helps people remain accountable to themselves with simple tools like to-do lists, journaling and follow-up exercises.
