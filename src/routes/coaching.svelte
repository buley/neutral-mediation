	<h2>Our Value</h2>
	<p>
		Coaching can help you be more positive and reduce negative emotions. It empowers you to feel more confident and make hard more decisions more rationally. With the help of a third-party, you can learn to minimize anxiety and worrying, stop self-sabotaging behaviors, and end procrastination. Manage anger and cope with stressful emotions better under the help and accountability of a trained coaching professional dedicated to your progress.
	</p>
	<p>
		A coach invites you into a proces of mutual self-discovery, changing yourself, your relationship to the world and, as a result, the world around you. A coach invites you to risk discovering who you are by receiving honest feedback and improve your skills, attitudes and behaviors -- joyously opening yourself to new ideas and taking risks you may have avoided.
	</p>
	<p>
		By increasing our awareness we can better use internal and external feedback to improve our skills and performance. We can also be more authentic, skillful and content with who we are as human beings. We can discover the vibrancy of the day-to-day world around us and become clearer, more authentic people.
	</p>
	<p>
		Awareness can be cultivated, exercised and enhanced. Living authentically can require greater energy, but long term there is more balance than living incongruously outside of integrity with our internal self. Congruence is a quality of connectiness of our thoughts, feelings, worlds, tone of voice, body language, facial expressions and actions.
