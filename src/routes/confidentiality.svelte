	<h1>Confidentiality</h1>

	<p>To promote transparency in mediation, California law generally makes mediation a confidential process. California's mediation confidentiality laws are laid out in Evidence Code sections <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=703.5.&amp;lawCode=EVID">703.5</a> and 1115 to 1129. Those laws establish the confidentiality of mediation and limit the disclosure, admissibility, and a court's consideration of communications, writings, and conduct in connection with a mediation. Generally, those laws mean the following:</p>

	<ul><li>All communications, negotiations, or settlement offers in the course of a mediation must remain confidential.</li><li>Statements made and writings prepared in connection with a mediation are not admissible or subject to discovery or compelled disclosure in noncriminal proceedings.</li><li>A mediator's report, opinion, recommendation, or finding about what occurred in a mediation may not be submitted to or considered by a court or another adjudicative body. </li><li>A mediator cannot testify in any subsequent civil proceeding about any communication or conduct occurring at, or in connection with, a mediation.</li></ul>
	<p>Mediations not legally binding by default.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Mediation acts in a dozen states.</p>
	<p>Is a meditation admissible in court? Yes. Confidential but not private. Be careful not to oversell.&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Possible interpretations of confidentiality:</p>
	<ul><li>I can share with others whose support is necessary to implement an agreement.</li><li>I can share with my professional advisors.</li><li>Doesn’t leave the mediation room.</li><li>My only limitation is seeking to enter mediation disclosures as evidence in civil litigation, arbitration, or administrative procedures.</li><li>I can report any confessed illegal activity to law enforcement personnel.</li></ul>
	<p>Qualifications to model code of confidentiality (12 states):</p>
	<ul><li>Is it a criminal proceeding?</li><li>The threat of imminent harm (Tarasoff case)&nbsp;</li><li>Child/Eder abuse statutes<ul><li>Usually not obligated, but permitted</li><li>Mandatory/Permissible reporter</li></ul></li><li>Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine<ul><li>What a person says is not admissible</li></ul></li><li>Allegations of malpractice Attorneys or Mediators?</li></ul>
	<p>Fuzzy confidentially</p>
	<ul><li>Build trust by showing confidentiality</li></ul>
	<p>California</p>
	<ul><li>Must be written to be legally enforceable in some jurisdictions, including California<ul><li>If not written agreement, wasn’t an agreement</li></ul></li><li>The agreement has to state explicitly that the agreement is intended to be “legally binding” (or words to that effect).</li><li>Include a clause for a settlement recite all material terms</li><li>Include a clause for a settlement agreement to wave confidentiality for purposes of enforcement and interpretation.<ul><li>People against this say open can of worms.. People are looking for closure.</li></ul></li></ul>
