	<h1>Benefits of Conflict Coaching</h1>

	<p>
		A conflict coach can help change thinking in order to improve subsequent emotions, decisions, actions and outcomes. Conflict coaches help to increase emotional wellbeing, reframe past experiences and change limited belief systems in order to move forward beyond stress and anxiety-producing conflict.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		They help set and achieve goals, make life changes, increase motivation, facilitate learning new skills and discover and change self-identity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Honesty, vulnerability and acceptance are among the key skills that a conflict coach can help someone develop. A coach helps make sure a client's actions are consitent with their abmitiations, aspirations, core values and beliefs.
