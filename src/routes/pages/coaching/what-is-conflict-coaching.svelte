	<h1>What Is Conflict Coaching?</h1>

	<p>
		A conflict coach helps individuals move beyond the conflicts that prevent them from reaching their true potential in terms of peaceful happiness.  There are a number of coaching models but most revolve around personal growth through goals and accountability. A coach helps people develop specific, measurable, attainable, realstic and time-bound goals for themselves. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Like a building a muscle, a change in behavior is not immediate and takes work. Results are typically seen within three weeks. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Weekly, fortnightly or monthly sessions are regular. Long-term coaching sometimes involves homework such as exercises or journaling.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A regular coaching session may follow the following structure:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="numbered-list">
		<li>Check-in for an update on changes and progress since last session, including reviewing any homework or follow-up exercises.</li>
		<li>Reassess goals and other desired outcomes.</li>
		<li>Determine the reality gap: the distance between where the client is today and where they want to be.</li>
		<li>Brainstorm options, explore solutions and incremental action steps that are available.</li>
		<li>Plan on and agree to certain action steps.</li>
		<li>Assign any homework and follow-up exercises.</li>
	</ul>
