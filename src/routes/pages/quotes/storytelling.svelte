			<p>Memory is a net: One finds it full of fish when he takes it from the brook, but a dozen miles of water have run through it without sticking.</p>

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>Memory is a complicated thing. A relative to truth, but not its twin.</p>

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>When I was younger I could remember anything, whether it happened or not; but my faculties are decaying, now, and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the latter.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>It isn't so astonishing, the number of things that I can remember, as the number of things I can remember that aren't so.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">
			Mark Twain
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure>
		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>An autobiography is the truest of all books; for while it inevitably consists mainly of extinctions of the truth, shirkings of the truth, partial revealments of the truth, with hardly an instance of plain straight truth, the remorseless truth is there, between the lines, where the author-cat is raking dust upon it which hides from the disinterested spectator neither it nor its smell (though I didn't use that figure)--the result being that the reader knows the author in spite of his wily diligences.</p>
		</blockquote>

			Mark Twain, <em><cite>Letter to William D. Howells,  1904</cite></em>
		</figcaption>

	<figure>
		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>Memories! Mankind is accursed because our existence on this earth does not tolerate any well-defined and stable hierarchy, everything continually flows, spills over, moves on, everyone must be aware of and be judged by everyone else, and the opinions that the ignorant, dull, and slow-witted hold about us are no less important than the opinions of the bright, the enlightened, the refined. This is because man is profoundly dependent on the reflection of himself in another man's soul, be it even the soul of an idiot.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">
			Witold Gombrowicz, <em><cite>Ferdydurke</cite></em>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure>
		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>[Story]telling is almost always done as a gift, even when the story contains and injects some poison, it is also a bond, a granting of trust, and rare is the trust or confidence that is not sooner or later betrayed, rare is the close bond that does not grow twisted or knotted and, in the end, become so tangled that a razor or knife is needed to cut it.</p>
		</blockquote>

			Javier Marais

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>Propaganda must not serve the truth... All propaganda must be so popular and on such an intellectual level, that even the most stupid of those toward whom it is directed will understand it. Therefore, the intellectual level of the propaganda must be lower the larger the number of people who are to be influenced by it... The size of the lie is a definite factor in causing it to be believed, for the vast masses of a nation are in the depths of their hearts more easily deceived than they are consciously and intentionally bad.</p>
		</blockquote>

			Adolf Hitler

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State.</p>

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>I wonder if there's a single place in the whole world that's never had a story. I bet not. I just about guarantee you there's no places like that in America. Every little square of it, every place you stomp your foot, that's where something happened. Something wild, maybe something nobody knows about, but something. You can fall out of the sky and right into some forgotten storybook.</p>
			<p>You run and run and run and you keep turning pages and none of them are empty. They're all full of stories. There's nowhere left to write.</p>
			<p>I think I'm just a bookmark.</p>

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>Stories save your life. And stories are your life. We are our stories, stories that can be both prison and the crowbar to break open the door to that prison; we make stories to save ourselves or to trap ourselves or others, stories that lift us up or smash us against the stone wall of our own limits and fears. Liberation is always in part a storytelling process: breaking stories, breaking silences, making new stories…</p>

		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>It's a strange feeling, realising that other people you don't know have their own, full lives that don't touch yours.</p>
		</blockquote>
		<figcaption class="pullquote">
			Mackenzi Lee, <em>The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue</em>
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
	<figure>
		<blockquote class="pullquote">
			<p>Sonder. You are the main character—the protagonist—the star at the center of your own unfolding story. You're surrounded by your supporting cast: friends and family hanging in your immediate orbit.</p>
			<p>Scattered a little further out, a network of acquaintances who drift in and out of contact over the years.</p>
			<p>But there in the background, faint and out of focus, are the extras. The random passersby. Each living a life as vivid and complex as your own.</p>
			<p>They carry on invisibly around you, bearing the accumulated weight of their own ambitions, friends, routines, mistakes, worries, triumphs and inherited craziness.</p>
			<p>When your life moves on to the next scene, theirs flickers in place, wrapped in a cloud of backstory and inside jokes and characters strung together with countless other stories you'll never be able to see. That you'll never know exists.</p>
			<p>In which you might appear only once. As an extra sipping coffee in the background. As a blur of traffic passing on the highway. As a lighted window at dusk.</p>
