	<p>Comfortable and ready to get going</p>

	<h3>Information Exchange</h3>

	<p>Helping these folks understand each other</p>

	<p>Doesn’t have as much emphasis in the Pepperdine system</p>

	<ul><li>The birth of the conflict is not a misunderstanding&nbsp;</li><li>Sometimes, more understanding is more repulsion</li><li>Honor the communication stage, but do not bank on it</li></ul>

	<p>Easy to get them to share their story. Hard to get people to understand each other.</p>

	<p>Communication and negotiation go together. Eats 70-80% of the time.</p>

	<p>Validation</p>

	<ul><li>acknowledgment of another's existence and importance, assurance that feelings and expressions are being recognized and valued.</li><li>listener must communicate that he will accept and value what is being communicated</li></ul>

	<h4>Communication</h4>

	<p>What are you looking for in the communication phase? Information related to the issues. Lead them toward resolution. Discovering information they need to make a decision. And also what the arbitrator needs to know. Emphasizing the parts that need to be heard.</p>

	<p>Pacing is very important. Have to hold people in the phase as long as necessary. The longer you can hold them into the Communication phase the more they go from combative to collaborative.&nbsp; Want to keep them out of the negotiation phase as long as you can. Slowing down to speed up.</p>

	<p>Mediators and participants communicate via words, intonation and body language. </p>

	<p>Restatement</p>

	<p>Paraphrasing</p>

	<h3>Negotiation</h3>

	<p>Encourage parties to test eachotherDiscourage counterproductive offers</p>

	<ul><li>Emphasize&nbsp; the&nbsp; danger&nbsp; of&nbsp; an&nbsp; extreme&nbsp; offer&nbsp; preventing&nbsp; the&nbsp; starting&nbsp; of&nbsp; the real distributive dance.</li></ul>

	<p>Normalizing the dance</p>

	<ul><li>People get frustrated by the back and forth.&nbsp;</li><li>A mediator can acknowledge the frustration and explain that the dance is just part of the process.</li><li>Explain is no right and wrong.</li></ul>

	<p>Extracting concessions</p>

	<ul><li>Can keep track of who’s turn it is to move and make the next concession</li><li>Compare and contrast to “what’s reasonable” based on experience</li></ul>

	<p>Confidential listener</p>

	<ul><li>Figure out, when people are way apart, what are their real goals in a positional distributive bargaining process&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, protect bargaining position and ability to bluff and maneuvers</li><li>When?

	<p>Creative problem-solving.</p>

	<p>Coaching</p>

	<ul><li>Question: message, impact<ul><li>Ask them what message they want to send?</li><li>Explain what the impact would be on others</li><li>Where do you want to be at the end of the day and how is that going to get you there?</li></ul></li><li>Coach: explain or offer a better offer<ul><li>Evaluative: I’m concerned because people who make an offer that way tend to see X as a response and get boxed in.</li><li>What ‘s the reaction you want and is this the best way to accomplish?</li></ul></li><li>Bargain<ul><li>What can you ad?</li><li>Can you push them?</li><li>Add sweeteners</li><li>Ask for a more reasonable offer</li></ul></li><li>Pocket (keep private)<ul><li>Change focus</li><li>Facts</li></ul></li><li>Present it with context</li></ul>

	<h3>Closing</h3>

	<p>Hard sell vs. consultative selling. During closing phase, mediator runs the highest risk of being a bully.</p>

	<p>The mediator becomes the salesperson. Someone needs to say the resolution is better than continued fighting. Advocate for resolution.</p>

	<p>A small portion of time, but a large part of the value of what people pay you to do.</p>

	<p>Outcome:</p>

	<ul><li>Willingness</li><li>Safety and hope</li><li>Expression and understanding</li><li>Flexibility and innovation</li><li>Informed Decision</li></ul>

If either says no, neither side finds out that the other said yes.</li><li>When?<ul><li>Exhausted analysis</li><li>No way to restart</li><li>Explored interests without success</li><li>Waited to see if parties would come up with something</li></ul></li><li>“Jump to an agreement” ends back and forth torture.&nbsp;</li><li>Could change expectations on what can get even if doesn’t work</li><li>Sometimes a negotiated mediator’s proposal</li></ul></li></ul>

	<h4>Barriers to agreement</h4>
